Measures of centrality 
Question : What is the typical value of an attribute in our dataset ?

Notation :

Mean from sample : x-bar
Mean from population : Mu

Mean : Centre of gravity

Sensitivity of mean to outliers :
Mean is sensitive to the outliers 
Median is not sensitive

Calculate trimmed  mean to overcome/avoid the effects of outliers on mean.
This is done by dropping the same number of extreme values from both the ends of the data points

Median

Mode


What do the measures of centrality look like for different types of distributions ?

For unimodal symmetric distributions mean = median = mode
For bimodal and multimodal symmetric distributions, mean = median but mode will be different 


Skewed distributions :

Left skewed distriution : mean <median <mode
Right skewed distribution : mode < median < mean
This is true except when there is a heavy tail on either side or if the distribution is bimodal/multimodal


Calculating median and mean based on a histogram

Calculating the mode from a histogram is not possible if binsize is more than 1

Measures of centrality could be the same for two sets of data ... but the variability might be different. Measures of spread will help understand that

Range is very sensitive to outliers - Similar to mean


Variance is a measure of consistency
